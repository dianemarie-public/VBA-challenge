' Create a script to loop through all the stocks for one year and output:
' Ticker symbol
' Yearly change
' Percent change
' Total volume
' Conditionally format highlighting:
' Positive change in green
' Negative change in red
' Challenge:
' Return the stock with the greatest percentage increase
' Return the stock with the greatest percentage decrease
' Return the stock with the greatest total volume
